# MainEvent 

MainEvent is user analytics like MixPanel, but open-source, deployable to your private network, and beats them on price-at-scale, privacy, and the ability to own, access, and remix or reuse your data.

## Why

*We Heart Events.* Everybody tracks events. Game events, app events, funnel events, commerce events and so on.

Every company I know is either paying too much for event tracking, or has built their own system.
Too much effort is wasted reinventing the wheel on what should be a standard utility for companies and projects,
so MainEvent solves that.  Generate events on any scale, attach any attributes to them, and report on them
in a clean easy dashboard.

## Open Source
Itâ€™s important that this product have an open-source component.  The core hate point is that teams are re-inventing the wheel every month, and there should be an off-the-shelf option that companies can standardize on as they scale, without wasting developer bandwidth on inventing the basics.  User analytics should be available to tech teams like web servers are - grab the standard, use it, and get as complicated and custom as your use demands as you grow, without ruinous cost.

## Enterprise
Unfortunately many companies can't benefit from modern event analytics, becausse all of the solutions are cloud-based.
We're launching a paid-license enterprise version that layers professional requirements onto the open-source version, such as:
* single sign-on
* audit trails
* security compliance (HIPAA)

## Analytics Packages
A plug-in architecture allows you to create and share standard tracking and analytics packages.  

Releasing a mobile game?  Install a stock analytics package that documents what events to instrument, and includes pre-build reports for funnels, retention, and other key information that you shouldn't have to build-out from scratch.
We're building a library of off-the-shelf report packages to get you running fast, with minimal effort.

## Status
* Event-tracking API is complete
* Event-reporting dashboard is in MVP
* Scalable analytics crunching is in progress with two devs
